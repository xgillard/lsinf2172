# LSINF2172

This repository contains the tooling that was developed in order to facilitate the 
development of INGInious-based evalutation for the LSINF2172 (Databases) class.

Concretely, it comprises the following folders:
+ _Docker_ which contains the dockerfile that defines the environment in which the tasks are evaluated
+ _python3_ a small library (also available on PyPI) which is used to facilitate the tasks scripts.

## Notes:
- The docker container is available on DockerHub : `xgillard/inginious-c-databases`
- The python3 library is available on PyPI `lsinf2172-inginious-utils`
