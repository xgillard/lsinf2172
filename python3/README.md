# Framework

This folder contains some scripts and helpers that aim at facilitating the development of
a manageable test bench for the student submissions on INGInious.

My goal while writing these is to replace the `bash` version of the `run` and `run_student`
scripts with others written in python3 (I checked with anthony, this is one of the foreseen
cases). This way, we'll be able to express both our tests and the interactions with INGInious
is a much clearer manner.

For further information, and my own record: check the documentation on readthedocs
http://inginious.readthedocs.io/en/latest/teacher_doc/run_file.html
